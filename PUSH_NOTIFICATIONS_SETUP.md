# Push Notifications Setup Guide

## Current Status
Push notifications are currently limited in Expo Go (SDK 53+). Here are your options:

## Option 1: Use Development Build (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Android Studio
1. Download and install Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Install Android SDK through Android Studio
3. Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable to your SDK path

### Step 2: Create Development Build
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

### Step 3: Install the Development Build
- The command will build and install a development version of your app
- This version will support full push notifications

## Option 2: Use EAS Build (Cloud Build)

### Step 1: Login to EAS
```bash
npx eas login
```

### Step 2: Build Development Version
```bash
npx eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### Step 3: Download and Install
- Download the APK from the EAS dashboard
- Install on your device

## Option 3: Test Local Notifications (Current)

Your app already supports local notifications when running in Expo Go:

### Test Local Notification
1. Open the app
2. Go to Profile page
3. Look for notification test functionality
4. Local notifications will work for in-app events

## Option 4: Use Expo Push Notification Tool

You can test push notifications using the test script:

```bash
node test-notification.js
```

## Current Implementation

Your app already has:
- ✅ Notification permission handling
- ✅ Local notification support
- ✅ Notification tap handlers
- ✅ Error handling for Expo Go limitations
- ✅ Push token generation (when supported)

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate testing**: Use local notifications in Expo Go
2. **For production**: Set up development build or EAS build
3. **For backend integration**: Send push tokens to your Laravel backend

## Backend Integration

When you have a development build, the app will:
1. Generate push tokens
2. Send tokens to your backend
3. Your backend can send push notifications via Expo Push API

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "SDK 53" errors: This is expected in Expo Go
- If notifications don't work: Check device notification settings
- If tokens aren't generated: Use development build instead of Expo Go
